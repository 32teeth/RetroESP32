> An ESP32 Wrover based Game Boy Pocket



## Welcome

Based on the popularity of: 
- [Gaboze Pocaio](https://github.com/32teeth/GabozePocaio-Round1)
- [Gaboze Pocaio Round 2](https://github.com/32teeth/GabozePocaio-Round2)



We have assemebled a team to pursue the development of:

* Hardware
* Software
* Firmware

A **new** *Game Boy Pocket* footprint based on the [ESP32 Wrover](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) from [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com)

### Why?

We love [Hard Kernel](https://www.hardkernel.com/) and their amazing product base including the [Odroid GO](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-go/)

We wanted to design, build and solution on trusted ***<abbr title="System on a Chip"><u>SoC</u></abbr>***. The ESP32 Wroom was selected for ease of use and extensive build tools available across all development platforms

### What?

The **Gaboze Express** is intended as an educational *'toy'* for the world of **Makers**
A low barrier to entry and NO soldering experience needed, AT ALL, there is NOTHING to solder, plug in and go!

It has full support for

- [x] ESP-ISP Dev Toolchain
- [x] Arduino Toolchain
- [x] Whatever else you want to throw at it
