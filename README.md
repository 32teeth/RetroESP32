> An ESP32 Wrover based Game Boy Pocket



## Welcome

Based on the popularity of: 
- [Gaboze Pocaio](https://github.com/32teeth/GabozePocaio-Round1)
- [Gaboze Pocaio Round 2](https://github.com/32teeth/GabozePocaio-Round2)



We have assemebled a team to pursue the development of:

* [**Software Branch**](https://github.com/gaboze-express/GabozeExpress/tree/Sofware)
* [**Hardware Branch**](https://github.com/gaboze-express/GabozeExpress/tree/Hardware)

### Hardware
> Testing FTDI Solution

Thanks to a recent contribution, we will be testing out the replacement of the CP2104 USB to UART bridge IC with an FTDI FT232RL IC

The FTDI IC is more hand solder friendly than the CP210x QFN series

Here is a teaser of what we are testing

A **new** *Game Boy Pocket* footprint based on the [ESP32 Wrover](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) from [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com)

### Why?

We love [Hard Kernel](https://www.hardkernel.com/) and their amazing product base including the [Odroid GO](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-go/)

We wanted to design, build and solution on trusted ***<abbr title="System on a Chip"><u>SoC</u></abbr>***. The ESP32 Wroom was selected for ease of use and extensive build tools available across all development platforms

### What?

The **Gaboze Express** is intended as an educational *'toy'* for the world of **Makers**
A low barrier to entry and NO soldering experience needed, AT ALL, there is NOTHING to solder, plug in and go!

It has full support for

- [x] ESP-ISP Dev Toolchain
- [x] Arduino Toolchain
- [x] Whatever else you want to throw at it
